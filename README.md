# byte-wing
Small PyGame project about exploration

Most of the `assets/images` were generated by AI excluding `wing-original.png` which I drew myself for quick testing.

Modules are stored in `assets/modules`. `wing.py` is basically the player. `particles.py` is the particles that `wing.py` uses as exhaust. `celestial.py` is used for asteroids in the background.
